For the Massachusetts Senate race in 2024, the Republican candidate needs to make voters more conservative about immigration. How many does she need to expose to Spanish-speakers to produce at least 10,000 voters with 12 or higher attitude scores?

```{r}

fit_1 <- stan_glm(formula = att_end ~ treatment + att_start,
                  data = trains,
                  refresh = 0,
                  seed = 1)
fit_1


```

Justice

y = mx + b
Don't merge variables like this: att_end = treatment(att_start) + Intercept

att_end = B_0 + B_1(treatment) + B_2(att_start) + error
